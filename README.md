Polygon Verifiable Credentials proof verification for ETH Global attendance.

Instead of ETH Global attendees having to stake 0.05 ETH to participate in the event, we instead propose that users receive reputation ERC20 tokens, after a successful project submission. These tokens are only minted after on-chain verification of Polygon veriable
credentials, issued by a suitable issuer node. The required QR code should be submitted after project submission.
The main smart contract implements logic for credential on-chain verification, submission of a survey concerning the event, and 
then mints a pre-defined ERC20 tokens to the users wallet. The tokens can then be used for future hackathon attendances, as well
as to share with collaborators and friends.
